# LANL-Earthquake-Prediction
This is a ML Competition hosted by Kaggle.
# Problem Statement
Basically you have provided a csv file which contains a continous acoustic signals(seismic signals) which are generated by mimicing the earthquake condition into the lab and based on the signals you have to predict the time to failure of an earthquake in the lab.Basically you have to predict the time left before an earthquake occured in the lab based on the acoustic signals provided. You can learn more about this problem at https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction
# My Approach
First of all with the help of various kernels I have generated qpproximately 1000 features which help to predict the time to failure.I have attached the ipynb notebook of how I created the features.After that due to the difficulty of the given data as the given data is not continous we have tried various approaches.We have used LGBM Model,Stacking and neural networks.At the end single LGBM model perform the best of all of them.I have attached all the ipynb notebooks of various models I tried.
